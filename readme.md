This is a web application launched with nodemon that uses a mongodb database. Users submit compliment to the database. A random entry is pulled from the database and displayed when the users visit the main page. Users cannot edit/update or delete compliments but the admin can.

Pie in the sky // v2.0 implementation:
Users enter custom fields at the beginning of every session to receive identity-specific compliments. Users upvote and "flag" compliments to change their display rate (display more and flag for admin review, respectively).
